# Kumauni Translation Project

This project explores the translation of the Kumauni language using state-of-the-art AI models. The focus is on data preparation, model experimentation, and creating a reliable translation pipeline. This work is ongoing and aims to address the lack of digital resources for the Kumauni language.

## Overview

The dataset was sourced from the [PahariLI repository](https://github.com/rachanagusain/PahariLI/tree/main/data). From this mixed dataset, only Kumauni language data was extracted and processed to form a dedicated translation dataset. This focused approach allows us to experiment with various transformer models and fine-tune them specifically for Kumauni-to-Hindi/English translation tasks.

## Project Details

- **Ongoing Project:**  
  This project is in progress and continuously evolving as we test different models and improve our data processing techniques.

- **Funding and Support:**  
  Funded by Neelesh Tanwar (Walmart California), this project aims to bridge the digital divide by preserving and promoting Kumauni language and heritage. The collaboration of diverse stakeholders emphasizes the importance of linguistic diversity in technology.

## Why This Project is Needed

- **Cultural Preservation:**  
  Kumauni is an integral part of the regional heritage, and there is a growing need to preserve it by creating digital tools that facilitate its use in modern communication.

- **Linguistic Diversity in AI:**  
  Most translation models focus on widely spoken languages. This project addresses the gap in AI research for lesser-known languages, ensuring that technological advancements are accessible to all communities.

- **Model Experimentation:**  
  By experimenting with multiple state-of-the-art models (such as MBART, mT5, and MarianMT), the project aims to identify the best performing model for Kumauni translation, ultimately contributing to broader AI research.
